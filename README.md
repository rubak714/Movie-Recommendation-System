# Movie-Recommendation-System
Here, a Movie Recommendation System is built using Machine Learning along with Python. This is one of the most important machine learning projects to get familiar with.
There are three types of Movie Recommendation Systems. For Instance:

**1. Content Based Recommendation System**

**2. Popularity Based Recommendation System**

**3. Collaborative Recommendation System**

## Work Flow ##
Step-1:</br>***Data Collection:*** Data that contains details about movie, for example: genre of the movie, cast, directors and so on</br>
Step-2:</br>***Data Pre-Processing:*** Data has to be cleaned/processed if there is any missing or altered value</br>
Step-3:</br>***Feature Extraction:*** Data is received as text data which will be converted as numerical values</br>
Step-4:</br>***Cosine Similarity Algorithm:*** Movies are converted into vectors. This algorithm will find similarities among those vectors. When a user gives a particular movie name as input, this algorithm will try to find best match where input movie gets coordinated with the recommended similar movie among list of movies
